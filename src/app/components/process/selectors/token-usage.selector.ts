/**
 * TokenUsageSelector — Epic 26 / Story 26-1 (ADR-022 §Decision 2).
 *
 * Thin read surface over the `tokenUsage` `PerAgentStore` owned by
 * `IngestionService` (registered on the single `PerAgentStoreRegistry` alongside
 * `state` / `context` / `commands` / `systemPrompt`). Holds NO state of its own.
 *
 * - `perAgent$(agentId)` is a façade over `tokenUsage.forAgent(id)`, mirroring
 *   `SystemPromptSelector`. It passes the store's `undefined` (never-run agent)
 *   THROUGH unchanged (ADR-022 §Open Question 2): the data layer stays faithful,
 *   and the member-chat pill (Story 26.2) owns the neutral empty-state render.
 *   `forAgent` already applies a reference `distinctUntilChanged` +
 *   `shareReplay({ bufferSize: 1, refCount: true })` with lazy current-value
 *   replay, so no extra pipeline is needed here.
 * - `teamTotals$` is a PURE sum over `tokenUsage.all$` (Σ every agent's
 *   `totalSent` / `totalReceived` / `totalCacheRead` / `totalCacheWrite`) — NOT
 *   a separately stored aggregate. Because
 *   `ProcessComponent` + its scoped registry are destroyed/recreated on every
 *   team switch, `all$` holds exactly the CURRENT team's agents, so the total is
 *   correct by construction with no team-id bookkeeping. The sum is a fresh
 *   reference each frame, so it needs a STRUCTURAL `distinctUntilChanged`
 *   (`totalsEqual`) to suppress no-op frames, plus `shareReplay` for OnPush.
 *
 * Scope: component-scoped (NOT `providedIn: 'root'`) — it injects the
 * component-scoped `IngestionService` from `ProcessComponent.providers`.
